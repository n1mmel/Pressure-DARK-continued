//	Welcome to config.ini. This is your one-stop-shop for small interface tweaks.
//
//	Each section contains a few tweaks that you may choose between. You may only
//	activate one tweak from each section at a time, so please make sure to follow
//	the directions carefully.
//
//	A double slash " // " at the beginning of a line denotes a comment, essentially
//	a line of code that will be ignored by Steam. For each section, choose one tweak
//	you would like to enable and simply remove the "//" from the beginning of that line.
//	Then YOU MUST add a "//" to the beginning of each other line in that current section.
//
//	Once you're done, save this file and restart Steam.
